# day 1

__decicions__
I decided to enable the user to safe a bible translation in SQL. 
Tried to download the whole chapter to SQL to prevent internet a next time reading that chapter.
However with multiple translations this will get messy soon. 
I decided to enable the user to select a translation (download it to SQL). The user will only be able to read a translation if the translation is already downloaded.
This way no volley is needed each time the user wants to read the bible.
To do this another activity is made, this will give cleaner code and is easy.

__progress:__
* One chapter is downloadable 
* the SQL basis is made to enable safing the translation (one for now)



# day 2

__decicions__

__progress__
* new activity is made
* One biblebook is downloadable with a volley


# day 3
__decicions__
* Decided to enable the user to download book by book instead of by bible translation due to insufficient memmory errors when trying.

__progress__
* Made check functions to check whether a translation is present in the database.
* Made a button to download the book when the book is not yet downloaded.
